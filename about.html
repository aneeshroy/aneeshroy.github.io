                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p class="editable-paragraph">I'm Aneesh, but all my friends call me Chiko. Growing up in Coppell, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, I've embraced the Southern hospitality I see all around me.<br><br>
                With the multitude of things I am interested in, its hard to pinpoint what makes me who I am. I think the best description comes from my parents, who've molded me from the bottom up. 
                My earliest memories have me responding to two different names; Aneesh for the academic demands, and Chiko for everything else. I didn’t come to this unusual realization that I lived 
                with two personas until I was older, and began to see how my two names morphed into two very different sides of me. I always thought one side would win over the years, but I understand
                 now that long ago they stopped fighting and started coexisting, an outcome I cherish every day.</p>

                <p class = "editable-paragraph"> I've engrossed myself in learning anything and everything with the hopes of eventually becoming a Jeopardy champion. In my free time, I play the drums and love to
                    produce music. In high school, my band Flood the Walls released an album I linked below. I watch and play basketball, and love to rock climb and swim as well. I will go to every concert I am remotely
                    interested in, and will basically try anything once.
