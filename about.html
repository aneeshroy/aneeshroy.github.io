                    My name is Aneesh Roy, but all of my friends call me Chiko. I recently graduated from UT Austin with a degree in Computational Engineering and a minor in Entrepreneurship.
                     As a gen-Z future professional, I have had the privilege to begin programming in middle school, where I have focused on algorithmic data processing and machine learning.
                     I am an aspiring Big Data professional so I can put my predictive skills to the test!
                     I strive to be a leader in all of my workplace situations, where I can flex my problem-solving, public speaking, and project management skills.
                    In my free time, I play a good amount of basketball and ultimate frisbee and love to talk about all things NBA.
                     Also, any conversation about your favorite movies or directors might get dragged on.
                      I am a musician and love to produce and play the drums, where I released an alt-rock album in high school.
